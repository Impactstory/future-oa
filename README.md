This is the jupyter notebook (manuscript.ipynb) behind the publication:

**Piwowar, Priem, Orr (2019) The Future of OA: A large-scale analysis projecting Open Access publication and readership. bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/795310**

The raw data needed to run the analysis is all available in Zenodo, here:

**Piwowar, Priem, Orr (2019). Data From: The Future of OA: A large-scale analysis projecting Open Access publication and readership [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3474007**

The notebook should run once you put those datasets in the a /data subdir and install all needed libraries.  
Apologies for the slightly, um, messy code -- this is our first jupyter notebook and it evolved over time.  We'll improve.
In the mean time huge thanks to the Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc teams for such a great toolset.
