This is the jupyter notebook (manuscript.ipynb) behind the publication:

**Piwowar, Priem, Orr (2019) The Future of OA: A large-scale analysis projecting Open Access publication and readership. bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/795310**

The raw data needed to run the analysis is all available in Zenodo, here:

**Piwowar, Priem, Orr (2019). Data From: The Future of OA: A large-scale analysis projecting Open Access publication and readership [Data set]. Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3474007**

The notebook should run once you put those datasets in the a /data subdir and install all needed libraries.  
Apologies for the slightly, um, messy code -- this is our first jupyter notebook and it evolved over time.  We'll improve.
In the mean time huge thanks to the Jupyter, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc teams for such a great toolset.

For others new to jupyter, and to help me remember:  do this to export the notebook to html:
```jupyter nbconvert manuscript.ipynb --to html --TemplateExporter.exclude_input=True```
 then push to github, then can be viewed at
<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Impactstory/future-oa/blob/master/manuscript.html">https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Impactstory/future-oa/blob/master/manuscript.html</a></p>

The actual submitted version had a few final tweeks in [Google Docs here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtGVKTQU7i6WGDIEtOGdrYgAxyhc7l51dBMUnn_CDpg/edit#) and 
then were exported to the gdoc_git export directory, and finally saved as a pdf.  Images are all in https://github.com/Impactstory/future-oa/tree/master/gdoc_export/images if you are looking for them (numbers not related to Figure numbers in text alas).
